BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE – ETL & DATA WAREHOUSING  

This project designs and implements a sales data warehouse for the fictional company Northwind Traders using the Kaggle Northwind dataset.
The team models a star schema, builds ETL pipelines in Pentaho Data Integration to clean and integrate raw CSV tables (orders, order_details, products, customers, employees, shippers, categories, date), and loads them into a MySQL‑based data warehouse for analysis.
The final result is a set of reusable SQL queries for core KPIs (Total Sales, Total Orders, Average Sales per Order, Top Products, Top Customers) and an interactive Looker Studio dashboard for business users.
